I am a Senior ML Researcher at Samsung Research UK. My research interests lie in the adaptation of large language models (LLMs) within resource-constrained environments such as smartphones. Particularly, I am interested to learn more about: 
- parameter-efficient fine-tuning for efficient adaptation of LLMs to downstream tasks (see our works on hypernetworks [[EMNLP'24](https://aclanthology.org/2024.findings-emnlp.929.pdf), [ICASSP'25](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10888301)]),
- decentralized training of models including LLMs (e.g., federated learning) for privacy-preservation,
- model merging to combine multiple LLMs or PEFT parameters for efficient deployment (see our work on adapter merging [[HydraOpt]https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.17706]),
- continual learning to train models progressively over time,
- model compression techniques (e.g., quantization, pruning, and knowledge distillation) to reduce the footprint of LLMs.

Previously, I was as a Postdoctoral Research Assistant in the [Computational Health Informatics](https://eng.ox.ac.uk/chi) group at the University of Oxford, led by [Prof. David A. Clifton](https://eng.ox.ac.uk/people/david-clifton), where I worked on developing generative models for healthcare, particularly for [disease progression modeling](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v184/ceritli22a/ceritli22a.pdf) and [synthetically generating electronic health records (EHRs)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.14679.pdf).

I obtained my PhD from the School of Informatics at the University of Edinburgh under the supervision of [Prof. Chris Williams](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/ckiw). During my studies, I was based in the [Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk) where I took part in the [Artificial Intelligence for Data Analytics](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-projects/artificial-intelligence-data-analytics-aida) project. As a part of this project, my thesis proposes probabilistic data type inference methods for tabular data. Prior to my PhD, I was a Research Assistant at the at Department of Computer Engineering of Bogazici University, working with [Taylan Cemgil](http://www.cmpe.boun.edu.tr/~cemgil/).
