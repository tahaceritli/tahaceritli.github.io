I am a Postdoctoral Research Assistant in the [Computational Health Informatics](https://eng.ox.ac.uk/chi) lab at the University of Oxford, led by [David Clifton](https://eng.ox.ac.uk/people/david-clifton). My current research focus is developing generative models for healthcare.

I obtained my PhD from the School of Informatics at the University of Edinburgh under the supervision of [Chris Williams](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/ckiw). During my studies, I was based in the [Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk) where I took part in the [Artificial Intelligence for Data Analytics](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-projects/artificial-intelligence-data-analytics-aida) project. As a part of this project, my thesis proposes probabilistic data type inference methods for tabular data. Prior to my PhD, I was a Research Assistant at the at Department of Computer Engineering of Bogazici University, working with [Taylan Cemgil](http://www.cmpe.boun.edu.tr/~cemgil/).
