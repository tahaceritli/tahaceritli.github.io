Welcome to my website!

I am a first year Ph.D. student at [The Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk) and the University of Edinburgh. I am supervised by [Prof. Chris Williams](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/ckiw/). Previously, I was a Research Assistant at [Perceptual Intelligence Laboratory (PILAB)](http://www.cmpe.boun.edu.tr/pilab/doku.php) at Department of Computer Engineering of Bogazici University, under the supervision of [Assoc. Prof. A. Taylan Cemgil](http://www.cmpe.boun.edu.tr/~cemgil/).

I am interested in Statistical Machine Learning. Currently, my research is focused on automatizing data wrangling process using machine learning.

You can find my [M.S. thesis here](files/ms-thesis.pdf).
